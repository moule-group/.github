# Moulé Group at UC Davis

Welcome to the Moulé Group at UC Davis! We are an interdisciplinary research team focused on Organic Electronics. Our projects, funded by various organizations, are centered on developing specialized instrumentation and processes for nano-patterning, layering, doping, and characterization of micro/nano-patterned organic devices.

## Research Focus

### Nano-Patterning and Organic Devices
Our current work involves:
- **Patterning Nano-Wires**: Developing techniques to create nano-wires with precise dimensions and properties.
- **Short-Channel Thin-Film Transistors**: Fabricating and characterizing transistors with short channels for improved performance.
- **Light Trapping Structures**: Designing structures to enhance the efficiency of photo-detectors and organic photovoltaics.

### Dynamic Disorder and Charge Transport
A DOE-BES funded project focuses on:
- **Dynamic Disorder**: Investigating the fundamental connection between dynamic disorder (instantaneous molecular/energy state displacements due to inter- and intra-molecular vibrations) and charge transport in organic semiconductors.
- **Inelastic Neutron Scattering**: Using this technique to measure phonon/vibration spectra.
- **Multi-Scale Simulation Tools**: Collaborating with a theory group to develop tools for simulating charge transport in organic semiconductors.

### 3D Characterization of Quantum Dot Super-Lattices
Our UC-lab-Fees funded project supports:
- **Electron Tomography**: Utilizing this method for 3D characterization of PbSe quantum dot super-lattices, providing insights into their structural properties.

## Funding
Our research is generously supported by:
- National Science Foundation (NSF)
- Department of Energy, Basic Energy Sciences (DOE-BES)
- UC Lab Fees Research Program

## Collaborations
We value our numerous international collaborators, who enrich and enhance the productivity and interest of each project.
